# Covid-19-Cases-prediction-for-next-30-days

This project focuses on predicting COVID-19 cases for the next 30 days using machine learning techniques in Python. Predictive models like these are crucial for providing insights into epidemic trends, aiding in policymaking, and assessing the effectiveness of implemented measures. The project utilizes COVID-19 datasets containing global confirmed cases and deaths. These datasets are sourced externally and are available in CSV format.
The project generates visualizations depicting the global spread of COVID-19 and forecasts the number of cases for the next 30 days. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning ARIMA model in predicting COVID-19 cases, offering valuable insights for decision-makers and researchers. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements.
